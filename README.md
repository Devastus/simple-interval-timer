Simple Interval Timer
=========================

This is a very simple interval timer, self-contained within a single HTML-file with no dependencies. Aims to work on small resolutions and all available browsers, including KaiOS etc.

To "install", just download the file. To use, open the file in your browser of choice. You can also just open the file here in the repo, but it is designed to support local use.

If you want more features, fork it. I do not care.
